<ul>
<h1 style="color:red;"><u>Process </u></h1> <br>
<li>Sign-in.</li>
<li>Be prepared to show your photo ID.</li>
<li>Have a seat and fill out a donor registration form,
which includes your name, address, phone number, and other
information.</li>
</ul>
<br>


<h2 style="color:red;"><u>Your Pre-donation Screening</u></h2> <br>

<ul>
<li>A CBC staff member will ask you some questions
about your health, lifestyle, and disease risk factors. All of this
information is confidential.</li>

<li>A CBC staff member will perform a short health exam
or "mini physical." It involves taking your pulse, temperature, and
blood pressure.</li>

<li>The health exam includes a finger prick, taking a
drop of blood and testing it to see if your blood iron level
(Hematocrit; the ratio of red blood cells)&nbsp;is sufficient for
you to donate. (All medical equipment used for this test, and
during the donation process, is sterile, used only once and then
disposed).</li>
</ul> <br>



<h2 style="color:red;"><u>Ready to Donate</u></h2><br>

<ul>
<li>If all your screening meets requirements, you will
be directed to a donor bed in the donor room.</li>

<li>A phlebotomist will clean your arm with an
antiseptic and use a blood donation kit to draw blood from a vein
in your arm. &nbsp;</li>

<li">You will donate one unit of blood (about one pint).
This takes about six to ten minutes.</li>

<li>After removing the needle the phlebotomist will
have you elevate your donation arm and apply slight pressure to
promote clotting.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2 style="color:red;"><u>Visit the Donor Caf� </u> </h2> <br>

<ul>
<li>When you are ready, you can walk to the Donor Caf�.</li>

<li>Have a seat and let the Donor Caf� worker or
volunteer bring you a drink and snack. It's a good idea to relax
for about 10 minutes and replenish until you feel strong enough to
leave.</li>

<li>The entire process usually takes less than one
hour.</li>
</ul>
                
 <br>                     
<h2 style="color:red;"><u> After Donation </u></h2><br>

<ul>
<li>Try to increase your fluid intake for the next 24
to 48 hours.</li>

<li>Avoid strenuous physical exertion, heavy lifting or
pulling with the donation arm for about five hours.</li>

<li>Eat well balanced meals for the next 24 hours.</li>

<li>Smoking and alcohol consumption is not
recommended.</li>

<li>Donors - seldom - experience discomfort after
donating. However, if you feel light-headed, lie down until the
feeling passes.</li>

<li>If some bleeding occurs after removal of the
bandage, apply pressure to the site and raise your arm for three to
five minutes.</li>

<li>If bruising or bleeding appears under the skin,
apply a cold pack periodically to the bruised area during the first
24 hours, then warm, moist heat intermittently.</li>

<li>If you have any questions concerning your donation
or experience any unexpected problems, please call CBC at +91 999999999.</li>
